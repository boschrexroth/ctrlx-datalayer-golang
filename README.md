# ctrlX Data Layer client and provider library for golang

This project provides:
  
1. ctrlX Data Layer access via Golang

    It wraps the original ctrlX Data Layer written in C++.

    You can find documentation and examples here [ctrlX Software Development Kit](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk/) and [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-datalayer-golang/pkg/datalayer).

2. Server-Sent Events(SSE) Client

    Server-Sent Events is HTTP/HTTP2 common standard, the SSE server pushes the update to the client, the client receives automatic updates via HTTP connection. 

    ctrlX Data Layer provides a SSE Server, which makes the data on the Data Layer accessible to the web application.  

    The SSE client library can be used to connect to the SSE Server of the ctrlX Data Layer running on the ctrlX Device. It is possible to subscribe to nodes on the server and the server will automatically send new updates on value changes.

    You can find documentation here [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-datalayer-golang/pkg/sseclient)

3. Token handling

    JSON Web Token is used for authentification in ctrlX Core. 

    The token library can be used to get token from ctrlX Core and later on check if the token is still valid. 

    You can find documentation here [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-datalayer-golang/pkg/token)
